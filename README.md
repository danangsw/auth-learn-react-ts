## What development tools we will use
- [Next.js - a React framework.](https://nextjs.org/)
- [SWR (stale-while-revalidate) - a React Hooks library for data fetching.]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr)
- [Axios - a library that helps you make HTTP requests from your web browser or Node.js server.](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Zod - a library that helps you declare and validate schemas for your data in React.](https://zod.dev/)
- [react-hook-form - React Hook Form is a library that helps you create and validate forms in React.](https://react-hook-form.com/)

## Yarn command
`yarn create next-app ui --typescript`

`yarn add axios swr react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers`

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
